        A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, often square image or icon that is associated with a website or webpage. It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, next to the website's name in bookmarks or tabs, and in browser history listings. Favicon images are commonly 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels in size, though larger dimensions are also used for higher-resolution displays
